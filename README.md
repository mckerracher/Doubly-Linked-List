# Doubly-Linked-List
## Boise State University CS221 Portfolio Assignment: Implement a doubly-linked-list
The architecture for this doubly-linked-list is defined in the IUDoubleLinkedList.java file, which includes all of the methods that must be included, along with their required arguments and the kind exception each must throw. The generic Java Type <T> is used, which enforces data type uniformity across methods.
